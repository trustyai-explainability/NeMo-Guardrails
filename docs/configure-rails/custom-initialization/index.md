# Configuring Custom Initialization

The `config.py` file contains initialization code that runs once at startup, before the `LLMRails` instance is fully initialized. Use it to register custom providers and set up shared resources.

## When to Use config.py vs actions.py

| Use Case | File | Reason |
|----------|------|--------|
| Register custom LLM provider | `config.py` | Must happen before LLMRails initialization |
| Register custom embedding provider | `config.py` | Must happen before LLMRails initialization |
| Initialize database connection | `config.py` | Shared resource, initialized once |
| Validate user input | `actions.py` | Called during request processing |
| Call external API | `actions.py` | Called during request processing |
| Custom guardrail logic | `actions.py` | Called from Colang flows |
