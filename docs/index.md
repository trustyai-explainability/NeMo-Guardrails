# NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails Library Developer Guide

{bdg-link-primary}`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/nemoguardrails/>`
{bdg-link-secondary}`GitHub <https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Guardrails>`

The NeMo Guardrails library is an open-source Python package for adding programmable guardrails to LLM-based applications. It intercepts inputs and outputs, applies configurable safety checks, and blocks or modifies content based on defined policies.

## About the NeMo Guardrails Library

Learn about the library and its capabilities in the following sections.
